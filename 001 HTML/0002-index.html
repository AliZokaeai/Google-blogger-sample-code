      <h1>This is a code without Attribute</h1>

    <p>We use HTML attributes to add more capabilities and advantages to our codes. For example, this is a paragraph
        without any more attributes. </p>

    <p style="color:blue; background-color: lightblue; font-size: 2em;padding:10%;">But this is a paragraph with
        added attributes in the opening tags. As you see, many things have changed here. </p>
